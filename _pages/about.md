Hello Human! I am a 4th year PhD student in Statistics at Ohio State University. I study distribution free methods, the effects of model misspecification, and statistical genetics. I am part of the Insect-Microbial Symbiosis Lab, led by Dr. Zakee Sabree, where I study the integration of transcriptomics, microbiomics, and imaging data.

My recent work has focused on using randomization-based tests in settings where the randomization hypothesis does not necessarily hold, even under the null hypothesis. The simplest example of such a setting is a test for two-sample difference of means when the full distribution of each group may differ. In that example, even under the null hypothesis, since the groups may have different variance it still matters which group a case came from. In my work, I develop tests for robust descriptions of distributions in the presence of covariates that are known to be important but whose exact effect is unknown.
